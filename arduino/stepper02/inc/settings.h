// settings.h
// to contain information about different arrays
// and how many files we need to include more

// example: number of motors in settings.h
// means we also need to include 6 more files
// and with each file of commands comes another header file

// layer1_header.h
	// header has a fixed amount of lines (like 1-2) and tells us how many
	// commands are there in commands
// layer1_commands.h
	// variable size from motor to motor
